# Reply System Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Input Box Layout 
**Problem**: Text box layout was misaligned
**Solution**: 
- Added proper CSS for `.conversation-compose` and `.input-row`
- Fixed flexbox alignment in `reply-styles.css`

### 2. ✅ Reply Button Visibility
**Problem**: Reply buttons weren't visible
**Solution**:
- Made reply buttons always visible (not just on hover)
- Added green WhatsApp-style styling
- Changed from emoji to "Reply" text for clarity
- Only shows on AI messages (not user messages)

### 3. ✅ Database Schema Compatibility
**Problem**: New schema columns weren't created
**Solution**:
- Modified database functions to work with existing schema
- Added fallback logic for missing columns
- System works without new schema fields

## How to Use Reply Feature

### Step 1: See Reply Buttons
- Each AI message now has a visible "Reply" button on the right side
- Buttons are green-tinted and clearly visible

### Step 2: Click Reply
- Click "Reply" button on any AI message
- This opens a reply preview showing the original message
- Input placeholder changes to "Replying to [Model Name]..."

### Step 3: Send Reply
- Type your reply in the input box
- Only the AI model you replied to will respond (1-on-1 mode)
- Other models can see this conversation in future group responses

### Step 4: Return to Group Mode
- After the AI responds, you automatically return to group mode
- Next question will get responses from all models again

## Visual Indicators

### Reply Preview Bar
- Shows above input box when replying
- Contains quoted original message (truncated)
- Has "×" button to cancel reply

### Direct Reply Messages
- AI responses to your direct replies are marked with "• Direct reply"
- These have a green left border to distinguish them

### Provider Icons
- Each AI model now shows its official provider icon
- Circular bubbles with company logos (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Fallback to colored initials if icon fails to load

## Context System

### Conversation Memory
- All models now reference previous messages in the conversation
- Follow-up questions build on earlier discussions
- Direct conversations are visible to other models

### Thread Awareness
- First question uses basic system prompt
- Follow-up questions use enhanced context prompt
- Direct replies use special 1-on-1 prompt

## Troubleshooting

### If Reply Buttons Don't Appear:
1. Check that messages are AI messages (not user/system)
2. Refresh the page to reload CSS
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### If Reply Doesn't Work:
1. Ensure message has an ID (check browser console)
2. Backend should show conversation mode switching logs
3. Check that AI model IDs are valid

### If Layout Looks Wrong:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check that `reply-styles.css` is loading
3. Verify WhatsApp CSS isn't conflicting

## Current Status
- ✅ Reply buttons are visible and clickable
- ✅ Input layout is fixed 
- ✅ System works with existing database schema
- ✅ Provider icons are displayed
- ✅ Context system is functional

The reply system is now fully functional! You should see "Reply" buttons on each AI message that allow you to start focused 1-on-1 conversations.
