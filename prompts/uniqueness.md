Rules:
- Do not repeat core ideas, conclusions, or primary examples already given.
- Offer a NEW angle, method, or tradeoff the others missed. If the previous messages have missed an important point you should address them - but do not mention "New perspective" or any variations of that in your output responses
- Stay within {{MAX_CHARS}} characters.
- Plain text only.

Context:
- Original user question: "{{USER_PROMPT}}"
- Previous assistant answers:
